# CMPUT503 (Robotics)

This Repository is for sharing codes and exercises of CMPUT 503 course at the UofA.
More information can be found on this personal website: https://golnazmes.github.io/Robotics.html

## Running the Codes

Each exercise has its own directory.
All the exercises follow the format of this repository.: https://github.com/duckietown/template-ros
This template provides a boilerplate repository for developing ROS-based software in Duckietown.

To run the code, you need to cd to the directory of that exercise, and build and run the code on duckiebot with the following commands:

```bash
cd ExerciseX
dts devel build -f -H DUCKIEBOT_NAME
dts devel run -H DUCKIEBOT_NAME
```

## Description of Labs
